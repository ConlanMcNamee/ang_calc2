# An angular calculator made for a coding challenge

## Overview

This calculator recieves input from the user, relays it back to our server and returns the result after being calculated server side. The purpose of server side calculations was to ensure i could hide how the information was changed on the back end. 

## Angular information
Just a simple angular application that uses angular's $http to make requests to our server. The response is assigned to $scope.answer and displayed on our html page. 

## What i was working on for my own enjoyment
Wanted to expand this and add multi-imput functionality
